Question 1
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2
They're initialized the same way (as in they both use socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)) 
but clients and servers have different methods available to them

client socket connect to the server and server socket receives the connection, for 
server socket we specify which port we listens in, for client socket we receives 
randomly

Question 3
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
which prevents address already in use error


Question 4
hostname, port

Question 5
data of 4096 bufferszie
